<!-- The landing page must contain:
     an explanation of the project
     a link to each visualization page.
    
    So the landing page will have a sidebar that has a preview image of the viz
    that image will be a link to that viz page-->

            <p>The purpose of this project was to analyze how weather changes as you get closer to the equator. 
                To accomplish this analysis, we pulled data from the OpenWeatherMap API to assemble a dataset on over 500 cities.
                <br><br>
                After assembling the dataset, we used Matplotlib to plot various aspects of the weather vs. Latitude. 
                Factors we examined included temperature, humidity, cloudiness, and wind speed. 
                This site provides the source data, the visualizations created as part of the analysis, 
                as well as explanations and descriptions of any trends and correlations witnessed.

<!-- Four Visualization Pages:
    A descriptive title and header tag
    The viz, regular sized
    a paragraph describing the viz and it's significance
    A side bar section with smaller versions of all four (links to respective pages)-->
