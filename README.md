# Module 11 Challenge
## Web

# Background
Data becomes more powerful when you share it with others! That’s because people can use your data only if they can access it. So, you’ll use HTML and CSS to create a dashboard using weather data and  visualizations.

# Website Requirements
* Your website must consist of seven pages.

* At the top of every page, your website must have a navigation bar.

* Your website must be deployed to GitHub Pages.

## Project Explanation
The purpose of this project was to analyze how weather changes as you get closer to the equator. To accomplish this analysis, we pulled data from the OpenWeatherMap API to assemble a dataset on over 500 cities.

After assembling the dataset, we used Matplotlib to plot various aspects of the weather vs. Latitude. Factors we examined included temperaturee, humidity, cloudiness, and wind speed. This site provides the source data, the visualizations created as part of the analysis, as well as explanations and descriptions of any trends and correlations witnessed.
